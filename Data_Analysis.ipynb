    "1. Plot histograms of the quantity of a given nutrient thoughout the vegetarian recipes\n",
    "2. Calculate median and mode (= most common value)\n",
    "3. Compare these with the FDA recommendation. NOTE this needs to be per serving - verify\n",
    "4. Calculate median and mode from omnivorous (original) dataset. For large differences with the vegetarian data, also view histogram. Compare together and with FDA.\n",
    "5. For vegetarian histograms with large discrepencies (some recipes with high levels of nutrient, others with low levels), cross-reference ingredients to see what may be responsible for providing the nutrient.\n",
